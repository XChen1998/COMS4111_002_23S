More importantly, one of my cousins had a sudden accident and was in a wheel chair during our stay. The apartment is very handicap accessible with limited stairs, spacey hallways and living space and also a detachable showerhead and tub railings. This is a huge plus because we were worried she would have a lot of trouble getting around but it was no hassle at all. The apartment itself is very clean and modern. We really loved the garden area which had a full set of chairs and table for relaxation and was also very private. Shelia and her husband were amazing hosts and helped with any questions we had.

I would definitely stay there again on my next visit to NYC. Also a short walk to subway stations so you easily get to where ever you want to go - but it is also a nice walk up and down Broadway to get to Battery park or to Time Square.

Al nostro arrivo Sheila ci ha mostrato come muoverci nell'appartamento e ci ha fornito di una guida con i consigli utili sulla zona. La dispensa per la prima colazione era ben fornita. E' stato davvero comodo avere a disposizione lavatrice, asciugatrice e lavastoviglie. Da non sottovalutare il piccolo giardino sul retro che regalava momenti di relax circondati dal canto degli uccellini. Potremmo continuare ad elencare i lati positivi della casa, dalla posizione ai servizi locali ma questo si può tranquillamente trovare nelle precedenti recensioni. Preferiamo invece dedicare delle parole alla gentilezza di Sheila e Manny. Abbiamo avuto la fortuna di incontrare due persone davvero straordinarie. Ci hanno accolti come amici di lunga data e così hanno continuato a farci sentire per i giorni successivi. Capitava a volte di incontrarli davanti casa tornando dalle lunghe giornate e subito ci invitavano a bere qualcosa di fresco per fare due chiacchiere. Abbiamo iniziato a consigliare l'appartamento ancora prima di rientrare in Italia e nel caso dovessimo fare ritorno a NY sarà sicuramente questo il nostro punto di riferimento. \\r\\nGrazie di cuore!! \\r\\nUn bacio <3\\r\\nAlessandro, Elisa e Daniele \"},\n   {'_id': '38247025',\n    'date': datetime.datetime(2015, 7, 14, 4, 0),\n    'listing_id': '2159898',\n    'reviewer_id': '8154696',\n    'reviewer_name': 'Jamie',\n    'comments': 'Our second stay with Sheila proved as interesting, welcoming and exciting at the first.

Let me say that she did not dissapoint!!!! \\n\\nMy best friend and I had never been to NYC before and really had no idea what to expect. Sheila was very communicative and even checked in via text a few times to make sure we had everything we needed. We had lots of questions and she was more than happy to help in any way. The apartment was spacious and well appointed. There was fresh fruit, nuts, pretzels, milk, butter and other condiments in the fridge which was nice since we arrived in the later evening. There were groceries right around the corner at a small market which was a 3 minute walk. The entire street was lively and incredibly beautiful, filled with shops and bars and restaurants. Plan to spend some time there as it's equally cool as the rest of Manhattan.\\n\\nThe back outdoor area was a definite treat and a charming place to relax. We sat on the front steps on Friday night and watched all the people come home from work. I could really feel the sense of community once Sheila and Manny joined us and the neighbors came around with hugs and we all shared some laughs. I felt so comfortable and safe there at all times. We slept very well every night, even when the street was pumpin, because the apartment is the basement level and towards the back so it's surprisingly quiet. There is private access to the gardens in back and above ground windows so it doesn't feel basement-like at all.\\n\\nThis is the place to stay if you want an authentic New York experience with natives that really care.
